Immigration Status Analysis in Canada

This Jupyter Notebook explores Canadian immigration data across provinces and CMAs (Census Metropolitan Areas), focusing on the periods of immigration for each region. The project uses data visualization, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python to draw insights about when people immigrated to Canada and where they settled.

Project Overview

This project includes:
Cleaning and preparing raw CSV data on immigration status and periods.
Creating stacked bar charts of immigration periods per province.
Displaying percentage distributions of immigrants based on the period they arrived.
Sorting provinces and CMAs based on the total number of immigrants.
Combining tabular views and charts to enhance clarity.
Deriving insightful summaries for both provincial and CMA-level trends.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
CSV Data Files

Files:
Immigration Status.ipynb: Main notebook containing all analysis and visualizations.
immigrant-status-and-period-of-immigration-e.csv: Source dataset used in the analysis.

Key Visuals:
Stacked bar chart of immigration period by province
Tabular representation of immigration percentages
Province-wise and CMA-wise rankings by immigrant population

How to Use:
Clone this repo.
Open the notebook in Jupyter.
Run each cell sequentially.
Replace the dataset if you have a more recent or extended version.

Insights:
Most provinces have a large share of immigrants arriving before 1996.
CMAs like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montr√©al dominate in total immigrant numbers.
Smaller provinces like Prince Edward Island show recent immigration growth.
